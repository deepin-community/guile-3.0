  * Mark test-out-of-memory as an expected failure for now.  Since this
    test has been failing for a long time on various architectures, mark
    it as expected to fail for now so that we'll still run it and can see
    the results, but won't be blocked by it.  There are known issues with
    the test upstream, and at least in some past cases it's been possible
    to reproduce the failure quickly by running
    test-suite/standalone/test-out-of-memory in a loop.  Add

guile-3.0 (3.0.1+1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Allow simultaneous installation of newer guile-X.Y-dev packages.
    Handle the one remaining common path /usr/share/aclocal/guile.m4 via
    update-alternatives as guile-autoconf-macros, since the macros it
    includes are explicitly intended to work across versions, and relax
    the package restrictions to allow simultaneous installation of both
    guile-2.2-dev and guile-3.0-dev.

    Have guile-X.Y-dev conflict with guile-1.8 to handle its 1:1.4-24
    libguile-dev conflict.  Apparently we had an epoch and then perhaps
    dropped it when we went to versioned packages (whether we should have
    or not).  In any case, that's old enough that it should be safe to
    ignore it given this accommodation.

    Version the libguile-dev virtual package provision.

guile-3.0 (3.0.0+1-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules: add build progress watchdog for slower architectures.
    Print "still going" every 10 minutes during the build so that builds
    on mipsel, armel, etc. won't incorrectly time out.  Guile currently
    compiles some of the initial bootstrapping files for a very long time
    with no output.

    Impose a hard 10 hour limit on the build in case it really is stuck,
    which is a bit more than the longest time noticed in the current
    buildd logs.  If necessary, we could rework the whole process to take
    the architecture's expected performance into account.

guile-2.2 (2.2.6+1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upgrade to 2.2.6. (Closes: 935256)

  * Change the /usr/share/slib trigger to interest-noawait.  From Julian
    Andres Klode's bug report:

      slib does not Depend on guile-libs, and I don't think it makes
      sense to add a Depends, so the trigger should be
      interest-noawait. (Triggering packages must Depend on the
      packages they are triggering otherwise ordering can be wrong,
      and installation can break).

      Now, there's also no point to not configure slib until
      guile-libs is triggered. It's enough to use noawait and thus
      only put guile-libs in the triggers-pending state, and it will
      be configured at the end of the apt run.

      Assuming a package wants to use guile with slib in its postinst,
      the package will need to Depend on both of them anyway, and that
      ensures proper ordering.

    Thanks to Julian Andres Klode for reporting the problem and Sebastien
    Bacher for providing the patch that Gianfranco Costamagna had already
    created. (Closes: #903907)

  * Don't fail the build if the after-gc-hook test fails.  Previously this
    was done for mips and mipsel.  Then a potential fix was added
    upstream, but the test has begun failing again on at least amd64, so
    for now, ignore it again.  Add
    0006-gc.test-after-gc-hook-mark-unresolved-on-failure-eve.patch to
    prevent the failure.

  * Backport upstream fix for after-gc-hook test failures.  Replace
    0006-gc.test-after-gc-hook-mark-unresolved-on-failure-for.patch that
    marked the failure as unresolved on mips(el) (a failure which has been
    seen since on at least sparc64 and amd64) with
    0006-Fix-gc.test-after-gc-hook-gets-called-failures.patch which
    addresses the underlying problem. (Closes: 900652)

  * Handle guile-config/guile-snarf/guild as alternatives.  Arrange for
    guile-config, guile-snarf, guild (and guile-tools) to be handled via
    update-alternatives with all of the other tools dependent on
    guile-config.  Configure with "--program-suffix -2.2" which gives the
    binaries the correct names from the start, so that we don't have to
    manually change them in debian/rules.  This also arranges for
    guile-config, etc. to refer to the versioned guile in their #! lines,
    which is what we should have been doing all along.

    Thanks to Ahmed El-Mahmoudy and Norbert Preining for reporting the
    problem, Kari Pahula and Vagrant Cascadian for help devising the fix,

    debian/autogen.sed and use it to generate the relevant debian/ files
    instead of perl and a make function.  That simplifies the quoting,
    and makes it easy to see the replacements.

  * Ensure DEBIAN files are ready for dh_installdeb.  Create a list of
    autogen_installdeb_files and have override_dh_installdeb depend on
    it.

  * Handle info pages via update-alternatives.  Install the unmodified
    info pages to /usr/share/info/guile-2.0/ and register them in
    /usr/share/info/ via update-alternatives.  See
    debian/guile-doc.README for more information.

  * Symlink guile and guile-2.0 to lib/.../bin/guile.  This avoids
    having a duplicate binary (bin/guile-2.0 vs the executable in lib)
    which also avoids colliding dbgsym packages.

guile-2.0 (2.0.11+1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Convert to Multi-Arch (see next two entries). (Closes: 757591)

  [ Peter Pentchev ]
  * Bump the debhelper compatibility level to 9 so that it passes the proper
    multiarch libdir to the GNU configure script.
    Add Multi-Arch: and Pre-Depends: headers to the binary packages as
    appropriate.
    Adapt debian/guile-*.install and debian/rules to the multiarch /usr/lib
    subdirectories.
    Make guile-libs.lintian-overrides a bit less specific, since we cannot
    use the full usr/lib/* path any longer; it changes with multiarch, and
    the contents of this file needs to be exactly the same on all
    architectures so that several guile-2.0-libs:* packages may be installed
    simultaneously.
    Avoid some libtool silliness by not letting it use -rpath at all; it'll
    try to because it "realizes" that "/usr/lib/<multiarch>" != "/usr/lib",
    so we are attempting to install to a non-standard directory, right?

  [Rob Browning]
  * Invoke "make install" directly so we can add INSTALL="install -p" to
    preserve the source file timestamps.  This should ensure that no
    architecture's .go files end up being newer than the .scm files.

  * Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt.

    Alexander Schmehl <tolimar@debian.org> for the previous, related
    1.8.4+1-2.1 NMU, and to Maximiliano Curia and Daniel Schepler for the
    original patch. (closes: #462384, #466778)

guile-1.8 (1.8.4+1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove ia64 from Architectures.  Since it doesn't look like "!ia64" is
    legal syntax for Architectures, just enumerate them all.  Guile
    doesn't support ia64 yet. (closes: #400401)

  * Use -Os on alpha rather than -O2.  Right now -O2 causes make check to
    fail with a segfault in r4rs.test.

guile-1.8 (1.8.3+1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Incorporate new upstream stable release.

  * Re-disable threads.  It turns out that Guile's libraries aren't ABI
    compatible when compiled with and without threads.  Since Etch shipped
    --without-threads, threads will remain disabled for now. (closes: #439923)

  * Add some lintian overrides.  Thanks to Ludovic RESLINGER.

guile-1.8 (1.8.1+1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Incorporate new upstream stable release.

  * Remove the debian/patches for items fixed upstream (all of them).

  * In accordance with the recent General Resolution
    (http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001), move all non-DFSG files to
    new packages that will be included in Debian's non-free section.  The
    debian/dfsg-splitter script has been used to split the upstream
    archive.

  * Version the doc package info files so that the doc package for each
    Guile stable series no longer conflicts with the doc package for other
    stable series.  This has made the virtual guile-doc package obsolete.

  * Delete debian/need-empty-autofiles-diff when not needed, always start
    with an empty autofiles.diff when regenerating, and fix a few other
    things in rules.

  * Work around a dh_installinfo bug.  It always inserts \Q and \E around
    the --section, which doesn't work.

guile-1.8 (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Incorporate new upstream release. (closes: #383910, #316083)

  * Compile --with-threads=no for now to avoid a thread-related bug.  This
    should be a temporary measure.

  * Move guile-config, guile-snarf, guile-tools, and guile scripts to
    guile-1.8-dev package.

  * Disable SLIB support for now since Guile 1.8 doesn't support SLIB
    upstream yet.

  * Rewrite the #! line of appropriate guile scripts to use the versioned
    binary name.  This should have already been the case, but the code in
    debian/rules wasn't quite right.

  * When autofiles.diff is empty, it doesn't show up in the resulting
    Debian source tree (via dpkg-source -x), so fix debian/rules to
    accommodate.

  * NOTE: the 1.8 package was branched from the 1.6 package before the
    1.6.7-3 release, so there are more recent 1.6 releases that are not
    shown below.

guile-1.6 (1.6.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Migrate from dpatch to quilt.

  * Fix FTBFS with gcc-4.0.  Thanks to Daniel Schepler
    <schepler@debian.org>. (closes: #300146)

  * Rebuild with current dpkg-dev to fix the cpp version in guile-snarf.
    Thanks to Daniel Schepler <schepler@debian.org>. (closes: #317600)

  * Update debian/rules to support autofiles.diff, autofiles-sync, etc.

  * Add (pending) upstream patch for compatibility with newer SLIB, but
    adjust the new slib.scm to load slib/init/guile.init rather than
    slib/guile.init in order to accomodate Debian's slib.
    (closes: #334735, #337346, #338823, #340149)

guile-1.6 (1.6.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * patch 50_m68k-smob-crash fixes m68k build crash.  Thanks to Sam
    Hocevar <sam@zoy.org>. (closes: #193870)
  * patch 50_ia64-ucontext fixes ia64 ucontext related build failure.
    Thanks to Sam Hocevar <sam@zoy.org>. (closes: #193868)
  * fix guile-1.6 conflicts with libguile-dev -- didn't have epoch so
    wasn't having any effect.  guile-1.6 needs to conflict with earlier
    libguile-dev versions because they didn't use update-alternatives for
    bin/guile-X.Y*.  It can't conflict with later versions
    (i.e. guile-1.6-dev and on) because guile-X.Y-dev is supposed to
    provide/conflict with libguile-dev. (closes: #198858)

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>  Fri, 29 Aug 2003 11:13:02 -0500

guile-1.6 (1.6.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * continuations.h: include ucontext.h rather than sys/ucontext.h on
    ia64.  This fixes a compilation problem for things that use libguile.
    Thanks to James Treacy. (closes: bug#191464)
  * make guile-1.6 conflict with libguile-dev since libguile-dev didn't
    use update-alternatives for guile-config and guile-tools.  I believe
    this is what has been hosing guile-config in guile-1.6.
    (closes: bug#183977, bug#188322)
  * really fix debian/rules to avoid --enable-maintainer-mode during
    normal package builds.
